        <p>
          Register using My Learning Plan (Frontline Education). Non My Learning
          Plan members will need to register and then print the confirmation
          form.

          What should I do if I do not receive a confirmation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Call us at least three days before your scheduled workshop. Do not
          attend a workshop if you have not confirmed your registration.

      <div>
        <p className="fs-4 font-bold">How should I dress?</p>
        <p>
          We suggest that you dress in comfortable, casual clothes. It may be
          helpful to dress in layers, since room temperatures are sometimes
          unpredictable.
